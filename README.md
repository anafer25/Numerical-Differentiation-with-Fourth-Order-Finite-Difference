# Numerical Differentiation with Fourth-Order Finite Differences

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **fourth-order finite difference methods** to approximate derivatives of mathematical functions. By comparing numerical derivatives with exact values, the program calculates and visualizes the error behavior as the step size decreases. The results verify the expected **fourth-order accuracy** of the method.

## Features
- Implements a **fourth-order central difference formula** for derivatives.
- Computes **numerical derivatives** for arbitrary functions.
- Measures and visualizes **absolute error** vs. step size.
- Generates **log–log plots** to verify convergence order.
- Easily adaptable to test other functions or points of interest.
